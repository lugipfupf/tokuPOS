tokuPOS
=========
This is just a basic readme. More might come eventually.

About
-----
tokuPOS is an open source POS system based on OpenbravoPOS, which has been forked many times. This version has been forked off UnicentaPOS 3.91.3.
It incorporates some changes and additions as requested by a small fashion retail shop in Switzerland:

- Swiss coins and bills
- some minor hard coded ui adjustments
- ability to sync product reference and barcode
- corrected and improved translations

Who can use it?
---------------
Anyone, it's open source.

Installation
------------
So far, no installer build will be provided. Just clone this repository and build it using Netbeans.

I need something done
---------------------
I'm doing this just for myself during my spare time. If you need something done, you have three choices:

- Do it yourself and file a pull request.
- Fork this repository and be your own master.
- Ask someone else
